## Enabling the plugin

There are two steps to enabling the plugin:

Adding the following line to an `.sbt` file in the `project` directory:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("no.vedaadata" %% "sbt-javafx" % "0.5")
```

(This makes the plugin available to your project.)

And adding the following line to your build `.sbt` file:

```scala
jfxSettings
```

(This overrides some of SBT's predefined settings in order to enable the plugin's functionality.)
